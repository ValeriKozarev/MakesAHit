## Final Presentation
Looking for a TL;DR? Take a look at our final presentation to get an idea of what this project does: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSQ89GPZbQcRiwf8o97hOvWL1dlJyL_Kdrq9HfyktNU0qZXspV0Z80RMo99h0PGGRGQvEi2eC46Th4m/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000

## Methodology
This repo is from a team project that I contributed to in Intro to Automated Learning and Data Analysis class. Essentially, we had to design and carry out a project that enlisted some of the techniques we had learned in class and it could be on whatever topic we wanted as long as we could justify our approach and interpret our results in a sound manner. Our project had three main components: A python script which used the Spotify API to build the initial dataset, an R script to clean and preprocess the data as well as run analysis on it, and a final script that used a genetic algorithm to build out song recommendations. The first part is a simple script which you can use and tweak as needed, the second part uses the Random Forest algorithm for our analysis. Here's an example: ![random forest algorithm](r_plot.PNG)

The second part (not included) was written by our teammate and it uses a genetic algorithm for generating Spotify playlists based on that analysis. You can see more about the methodology and results in the slideshow linked above!
