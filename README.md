# MakesAHit

This is part of a class project that I contributed to called MakesAHit. For our Intro to Automated Learning and Data Analysis class we had to design and carry out a project that enlisted some of the techniques we had learned in class. The first part (this repo) uses the Random Forest algorithm for analyzing and grouping songs from a Spotify playlist based on song features into a genre. The second part which was written by our teammate uses a genetic algorithm for generating Spotify playlists based on that analysis.

Take a look at our final presentation to get an idea of what the final product looks like: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSQ89GPZbQcRiwf8o97hOvWL1dlJyL_Kdrq9HfyktNU0qZXspV0Z80RMo99h0PGGRGQvEi2eC46Th4m/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000
